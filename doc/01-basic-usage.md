# Basic usage

## Create a notifier

JoliNotif provides a `NotifierFactory` which creates the best supported
notifier according to your platform. You don't have to care if you're running
on Linux, Windows or Mac OS:

```php
use Joli\JoliNotif\NotifierFactory;

$notifier = NotifierFactory::create();
```

The factory use the notifier's priority to determine the best notifier to use.
For example some notifier has a low priority because they don't support some
notification options. The best notifier will then be returned.

> **Note**: The factory currently returns null if not any notifier is supported
> on your system.

## Create your notification

Create a notification is as simple as instantiating a `Notification` and
setting the option you want to use:

```php
use Joli\JoliNotif\Notification;

$notification =
    (new Notification())
    ->setBody('The notification body')
    ->setTitle('The notification title')
;
```

As you can see, the notification provides a fluent API.

## Sending the notification

Now that you get your notification, just send it via the notifier:

```php
$notifier->send($notification);
```

And you're done!
